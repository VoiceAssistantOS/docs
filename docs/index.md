# Voice Assistant OS

## This page is under construction, check back later!

Voice Assistant OS is a versatile Operating System designed for single board computers such as the Raspberry Pi or a generic x86_64 computer. Of course this project is far from finished, and being honest with myself, it probably never will be finished. For some more information on this project, check out the other pages of this site, or the (discord server)[https://discord.gg/YHwUZHQAP7]!

As this project progresses, these docs will be updated significantly. For now though, they're pretty much empty.
